                <p>Hi there! My name is <span id="bold">Olha Melska</span> and I'm from Ukraine. </p>

                <p>I'm a beginner Web Developer with a strong desire to propose and develop innovative solutions to optimize, code and develop new functionalities for a better user experience. Individual with a fearless approach to new software platforms, fast learner and hard-working person with a great goal to succeed.</p>

                <p>I came to the United States 2.5 years ago. Now, I'm attending a coding bootcamp at <span id="bold">Columbia Engineering</span>, Full Stack Web Development program.</p>

                <p>Before that I took a part-time Front-End Web Development class at <span id="bold">Flatiron School</span>.</p>

                <p>Back in Ukraine I finished three years of <span id="bold">Computer Sciences</span> at <span id="bold">Lviv National Polytechnic University</span>.</p>

                <p>Besides, I graduated a <span id="bold">Computer Academy STEP</span>, Sunday School. I went there for five years since I was 11 years old. There I touched a few basics:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>C++</li>
                    <li>HTML</li>
                    <li>Css</li>
                    <li>JavaScript</li>
                    <li>Flash animation</li>
                    <li>3DS Max</li>
                    <li>Adobe Photoshop</li>
                    <li>Adobe Illustrator</li>
                    <li>Adobe Premiere</li>
                    
                </ul>
                <p>Since I changed the country of living, it took me two years before I finally managed going back to school. I was working at different restraunts, starting from casual dining and moving forward to fine dining and Michelin Star restaurant experience. Now, I'm working at <span id="bold">LifeWorks Technology Group</span> as an <span id="bold">Executive Sales Assistant</span>.</p>
